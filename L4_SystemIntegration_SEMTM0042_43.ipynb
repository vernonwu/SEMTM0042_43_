It may intuitively feel like any error in the kinematic model will be systematic (repeating, deterministic), and so the only consequence would be a coordinate frame that is slightly skewed (stretched or distorted).  However, in actuality, a poor kinematic model will mean that the displacement of your robot within the coordinate frame is incorrect.  This is because it is information in the local frame that is being transformed into a position in the global frame at every time step.  Therefore, it is not the global frame that presents the error, but how the robot is represented as moving within it.  Your robot will not move in a systematic way for various reasons, but the most obvious is that the puck location is randomised."

If you are using a PID heading controller for rotating your robot, you may also encounter extreme input demand values.  For any rotation to a target, the most extreme rotation should be 180°.  However, you can probably achieve much better performance for your heading controller if you instead optimise the PID gains for demand values within a significantly smaller range.  For example the robot will only be asked to rotate within +/-30° by limiting the demand value.  Therefore, you would want to **clamp the input** to your heading controller.  Would doing this have a significant impact on your robot's ability to turn toward a target more than the clamped value?
