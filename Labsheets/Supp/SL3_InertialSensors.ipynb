These are digital sensors that communicate via the `i2c` protocol (\"i squared c\", <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C\">inter-integrated circuit</a>).  Each sensor has an address, and from the 32u4 microcontroller we request to write settings or read values.  We will also use the `LSM6` library provided by Pololu to operate the acceleromter and gyroscope.  We will also use the `LIS3MDL` library from Pololu to operate the magenetometer.  These libraries will provide the functionality to read from the sensors, but we will still need to develop code to process the sensor readings.\n",

        "During your experimentation, you should have seen that although the low-pass filtered heading from the magnetometer is pretty reliable when the robot is stationary.  When the robot begins to move, the heading estimate from the magnetometer does not keep up with the movement.  Because of this, another name for the filter above is the <i>lag</i> filter.  This means that while we can trust the low-pass filter to give us a good estimate in the long term, on short time scales, it may be wrong.\n",
        "\n",
        "To get a better estimate of the robot's heading, we need to combine the lag filter with a second source of information that is reliable over these short time scales. A simple way of doing this is with a complementary filter.\n",
        "\n",
        "To fully understand the details of a complementary filter, we would need to introduce frequency domain control design. Intuitively, we can think of a complementary filter as deciding which of two sources of information to trust.\n",
        "\n",
        "One sensor (the magnetometer) in our case is trusted on long time scales, while another (The gyroscope in this case) is trusted only in the short term. A simple way to implement a complementary filter is with:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ heading_t = \\alpha * (heading_{t-1} + gyro\\_reading * elapsed\\_time) + ((1-\\alpha)*mag\\_reading) $$\n",
        "\n",
        "We should set alpha in the range [ 0.0 : 1.0 ], typically something higher like `0.9`.  In this case, if the gyro_reading is small (i.e we are not rotating quickly), the heading would converge towards the output of the low pass filter we implemented in the previous exercise.  However, if we do start to move quicky, then the gyro_reading will be integrated and added to the heading, allowing us to respond to quick changes as they are happening.\n",

        "A `G-H filter` estimates a variable (say the heading) as a weighted sum of a prediction and a measurement. We can use a similar idea to combine the information from our encoders with the information from the complementary filter. This should give us a heading estimate which is robust to things like wheel slip and collisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "To implement such a system on the 3Pi+, we can use the estimate of angular velocity we get from the Kinematics as our \"prediction\" and then correct this with the measurement from our Complementary filter. The update equations then look like:\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Implement this update on the 3Pi+. You will need to select appropriate values for the two constants $g$ and $h$. Conduct an experiment to see how varying these parameters effect the output of the filter.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Integrate these updates into your kinematic class. You will need to keep the heading calculated purely from the encoder counts, but you can add a complementary_heading and g_h_filter_heading variable to the class and update them with everything else. You can then use the heading angle calculated by the g_h_filter for the position update in your Kinematics.\n",
        "  - Hint: Remember that both the magnetometer and IMU are updated internally at a set rate. You can find this (and how to change it) in the datasheets. You should ensure your Kinematics are not updated faster than the IMU/Magnetometer.\n",
