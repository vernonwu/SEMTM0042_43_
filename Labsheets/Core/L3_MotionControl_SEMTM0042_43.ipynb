        "\n",
        "- The **local** and **global** coordinate frame.\n",
        "- The roles of parameters in the **kinematic model**.\n",
        "- The necessity of **calibrating** the kinematic model.\n",
        "- The relationship between **robot behaviours**, the kinematic model, and sources of **odometric error**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Objectives:**\n",
        "\n",
        "At this stage, we need the robot to:\n",
        " - Track it's position over time (**odometry**).\n",
        " - To rotate to face specific directions.\n",
        " - To travel until a target is reached.\n",
        " - To join rotation and travel behaviours together so that from any position on the coursework map, the robot can efficiently move to another position.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Context:**\n",
        "\n",
        "You have probably noticed that the above objectives are very similar to the previous labsheet.  In the previous labsheet, we wrote some **open-loop** code to perform simple rotation and translation based on a time duration in milliseconds.  By the end of the previous labsheet, you will have also written **closed-loop** PID control for wheel speed.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this labsheet, we will write rotation and translation behaviours that are **closed-loop**.  For example, this means we want the robot to rotate to a specific angle of orientation.  As closed-loop control, if the robot was to rotate too far, we would expect it to automatically attempt to rotate back.\n",
        "\n",
        "To do this, we need an information source to act as our measurement, and a target to act as the demand.  For both, we can utilise the **rotary encoder** counts to estimate the change of the position of the robot over time, referred to as **odometry**. Doing so means that the robot can utilise a cartesian coordinate system (i.e., $x$, $y$ and $\\theta$) to navigate and control it's motion.  If we are going to use **odometry**, then it is important that the underlying kinematic model is accurate.\n"

        "\n",
        "For example, if the robot begins facing 90°, and we want the robot to face 180°, we know that the required rotation of the whole robot is +90° (the difference).  We then know that the wheels are positioned an equal distance away from the centre of the robot, and so each wheel will need to travel an arc in opposite directions to have the robot rotate on the spot.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Our calculation would effectively be a quarter  of the circumference of a circle traced by the wheels (90 is a quarter of 360), where the position of the wheels relative to the centre of the robot is the radius of the circle being traced.\n",
        "\n",
        "If we know the distance a wheel must travel along for a 90° turn, we could easily convert this to a required number of encoder counts for each wheel to rotate.  To ensure the robot rotates on the spot, it would be good to control wheel velocity, and therefore calculate how much time is required at a wheel velocity to acheive the required encoder count (or distance).  Utilising a model like this is **inverse kinematics** : how to configure the robot to achieve a desired end effector position.   \n",

In a reactive approach we iteratively react (respond) to the current state of the system.  In this approach, we would rely on the **forward kinematic** model to update the displacement of the robot as the wheels are turning at each time step.  \n",

When there is a small amount of rotation error, your motors will probably have moved into their **dead-band** region (not enough power to rotate), or the difference in rotation angle is not being mathematically manipulated to a useful speed demand.  It would therefore be useful if your robot could somehow \"know\" when it was stuck and respond.  This can be achieved with a PI-Controller (a controller that uses both the proportional term and the integral term).  If the robot has turned and stopped with a small amount of error, the i-term will continue to integrate this error over time.  At some point, the i-term will contribute enough feedback to cause the motors to operate outside of their dead-band, and the robot will rotate."
